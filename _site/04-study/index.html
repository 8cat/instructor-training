<p>Continuing with our theme of instructor-as-performer,
let’s discuss some research that suggests that improvement in educational outcomes
must be driven by practice and communities of practice.
The tricks and techniques that make teaching effective cannot be mandated from above,
but will develop into widespread effectiveness
only as they are shared through a community of teaching practice.</p>

<h2 id="lesson-study">Lesson Study</h2>

<p>Many people assume that teachers are born, not made.
From politicians to researchers and teachers themselves,
most reformers have designed systems to find and promote those who can teach
and eliminate those who can’t.
As Elizabeth Green describes in
<em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Building-Better-Teacher-Teaching-Everyone/dp/0393081591/">Building a Better Teacher</a></em>,
though,
that assumption is wrong,
which is why educational reforms based on it have repeatedly failed.</p>

<p>The book is written as a history of the people who have put that puzzle together in the US.
Its core begins with a discussion of what James Stigler discovered during a visit to Japan in the early 1990s:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some American teachers called their pattern “I, We, You”:
After checking homework,
teachers announced the day’s topic,
demonstrating a new procedure (I)…
Then they led the class in trying out a sample problem together (We)…
Finally, they let students work through similar problems on their own,
usually by silently making their way through a worksheet (You)…</p>

  <p>The Japanese teachers, meanwhile, turned “I, We, You” inside out.
You might call their version “You, Y’all, We.”
They began not with an
introduction,
but a single problem that students spent ten or twenty
minutes working through alone (You)…
While the students worked,
the teacher wove through the students’ desks,
studying what they came up with and taking notes to remember who had which idea.
Sometimes the teacher then deployed the students to discuss the problem in small
groups (Y’all).
Next, the teacher brought them back to the whole group,
asking students to present their different ideas for how to solve the problem on the chalkboard…
Finally, the teacher led a discussion,
guiding students to a shared conclusion (We).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s tempting but wrong to think that this particular teaching technique is Japan’s secret sauce.
The actual key is revealed in the description of Akihiko Takahashi’s work.
In 1991,
he visited the United States in a vain attempt to find the classrooms described a decade earlier
in a report by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics.
He couldn’t find them.
Instead, he found that American teachers met once a year (if that) to exchange ideas about teaching,
compared to the weekly or even daily meetings he was used to.
What was worse:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The teachers described lessons they gave and things students said,
but they did not <em>see</em> the practices.
When it came to observing actual lessons — watching each other teach —
they simply had no opportunity…
They had, he realized, no <em>jugyokenkyu</em>.
Translated literally as “lesson study”,
<em>jugyokenkyu</em> is a bucket of practices that Japanese teachers use to hone their craft,
from observing each other at work to discussing the lesson afterward
to studying curriculum materials with colleagues.
The practice is so pervasive in Japanese schools that it is…effectively invisible.</p>

  <p>And here lay the answer to [Akihiko’s] puzzle.
Of course the American teachers’ work fell short of the model set by their best thinkers…
Without <em>jugyokenkyu</em>, his own classes would have been equally drab.
Without <em>jugyokenkyu</em>, how could you even teach?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what does <em>jugyokenkyu</em> look like in practice?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In order to graduate,
education majors not only had to watch their assigned master teacher work,
they had to effectively replace him,
installing themselves in his classroom first as observers and then,
by the third week, as a wobbly…approximation of the teacher himself.
It worked like a kind of teaching relay.
Each trainee took a subject,
planning five days’ worth of lessons… [and then] each took a day.
To pass the baton,
you had to teach a day’s lesson in every single subject:
the one you planned and the four you did not…
and you had to do it right under your master teacher’s nose.
Afterward,
everyone — the teacher, the college students, and sometimes even another outside observer —
would sit around a formal table to talk about what they saw.</p>

  <p>[Trainees] stayed in…class until the students left at 3:00 pm,
and they didn’t leave the school until they’d finished discussing the day’s events,
usually around eight o’clock.
They talked about what [the master teacher] had done,
but they spent more time poring over how the students had responded:
what they wrote in their notes;
the ideas they came up with, right and wrong;
the architecture of the group discussion.
The rest of the night was devoted to planning…</p>

  <p>…By the time he arrived in [the US],
[Akihiko had] become…famous…
giving public lessons that attracted hundreds,
and, in one case, an audience of a thousand.
He had a seemingly magical effect on children…
But Akihiko knew he was no virtuoso.
“It is not only me,” he always said…
“<em>Many</em> people.”
After all, it was his mentor…who had taught him the new approach to teaching…
And [he] had crafted the approach along with the other math teachers
in [his ward] and beyond.
Together, the group met regularly to discuss their plans for teaching…
[At] the end of a discussion,
they’d invite each other to their classrooms to study the results.
In retrospect,
this was the most important lesson:
not how to give a lesson, but how to study teaching,
using the cycle of <em>jugyokenkyu</em> to put…work under a microscope and improve it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Putting work under a microscope in order to improve it is commonplace in sports and music.
A professional musician, for example,
will dissect half a dozen different recordings of “Body and Soul” or “Smells Like Teen Spirit” before performing it.
They would also expect to get feedback from fellow musicians during practice and after performances.
Many other disciplines work this way too:
the Japanese drew inspiration from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming">Deming</a>’s ideas
on continuous improvement in manufacturing,
while the adoption of code review over the last 15 years
has done more to improve everyday programming than any number of books or websites.</p>

<p>But this kind of feedback isn’t part of teaching culture in English-language school systems:
in the US, Canada, the UK, Australia, and elsewhere,
what happens in the classroom stays in the classroom.
Teachers don’t watch each other’s lessons on a regular basis,
so they can’t borrow each other’s good ideas.
The result is that <em>every teacher has to invent teaching on their own</em>.
They may get lesson plans and assignments from colleagues,
the school board,
a textbook publisher,
or the Internet,
but each teacher has to figure out on their own how to combine that with
the theory they’ve learned in education school
to deliver an actual lesson in an actual classroom for actual students.</p>

<p>Fincher and her colleagues studied how teaching practices are actually transferred
using both <a href="http://0.0.0.0:4000/papers/fincher-warrens-question-2007.pdf">a detailed case study</a>
and
<a href="http://0.0.0.0:4000/papers/fincher-stories-change-2012.pdf">analysis of change stories</a>.
As the abstract of the latter paper says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Innovative tools and teaching practices often fail to be adopted by educators in the field,
despite evidence of their effectiveness.
Naïve models of educational change assume this lack of adoption arises from
failure to properly disseminate promising work,
but evidence suggests that dissemination via publication is simply not effective…
We asked educators to describe changes they had made to their teaching practice
and analyzed the resulting stories…
Of the 99 change stories analyzed,
only three demonstrate an active search for new practices or materials on the part of teachers,
and published materials were consulted in just eight of the stories.
Most of the changes occurred locally,
without input from outside sources,
or involved only personal interaction with other educators.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As stated at the beginning, the main goal of this training is to be this kind of
lesson study, where instructors can come together to discuss and share practices,
and to get feedback.</p>

<blockquote class="challenge">
  <h2 id="feedback-on-yourself">Feedback on Yourself</h2>

  <p>Split into groups of three,
and then have each person introduce themselves and
then teach a 90-second lesson on
the most interesting aspect of their own research or work
to another person in the group
while the third person records it (video and audio)
using a cell phone or some other handheld device.
After the first person finishes,
rotate roles
(she becomes the videographer,
her audience becomes the instructor,
the person who was recording becomes the audience)
and then rotate roles again.
After everyone in the group of three has finished teaching,
watch the videos as a group.  After watching all the videos,
give feedback on each person’s strengths and weaknesses.
Returning to the large group, share your strengths and weaknesses with others.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="on-stage">On Stage</h2>

<blockquote class="challenge">
  <h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>

  <p>How was the experience of being videoed/receiving feedback?  What
did people notice?  What are some of your “tells”?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everyone has nervous habits.  While these habits are often not as noticeable
as you would think, it’s good to identify ways to keep yourself from pacing,
or fiddling with your jewellery, or not looking at the audience.</p>

<p>Mickey Mouse version of self.
(not done writing yet)</p>

<p>But just like everyone has their own nervous habit, each person has their own
particular strength.  Musicians can be very different (but equally effective!)
in their performance of the same piece; similarly, teachers can present the same material
in very different ways.  The uniqueness of your teaching style can and should
be based on your strengths.  This is why it’s just as important to identify strengths
as weaknesses when trying to improve your teaching.  It’s good to know what you do well!</p>

  <p>If you were a cartoon character teacher, who would you be?  What does that say about your
teaching style?</p>

<h2 id="feedback">Feedback</h2>

<p>Sometimes it can be hard to receive negative feedback.</p>

<p><img src="http://0.0.0.0:4000/fig/04/deathbulge-jerk.jpg" alt="Feedback Feelings" title="Comic from http://www.deathbulge.com/comics/155" /></p>

<blockquote class="challenge">
  <h2 id="discussion-2">Discussion:</h2>

  <p>What are some
strategies you use to receive and handle feedback?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is a list of some strategies to make sure that you can receive feedback
in a way that helps you improve:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mental habits matter!  Tell yourself the right things, like:
    <ul>
      <li>“It’s not personal.”</li>
      <li>“Look at the positives along with the negatives.”</li>
      <li>etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Initiate feedback.  It’s better to ask for feedback than to receive it unwillingly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Choose your own questions.  I’m a big fan of feedback questions like “what is
  one thing I could have done as a teacher to make this lesson more
  effective?”  Or “If you could pick one thing from the lesson to go over
  again, what would it be?”  These questions (hopefully)
  reveal what didn’t work in your teaching, but read as professional suggestions
  rather than personal judgments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Balance positive and negative feedback:
    <ul>
      <li>ask for or give “compliment sandwiches” (one positive, one negative, one positive)</li>
      <li>ask for both types of feedback</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Communicate expectations. If your teaching feedback is taking the form of an
  observation (and you’re comfortable enough with the observer), tell
  that person how they can best communicate their feedback to you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Use a feedback translator.  This is one of my favorite ways to get feedback when
I have to read it right away (mid-lesson feedback during Software
Carpentry workshops, for example).  I have my fellow
instructor (or other trusted person in the room) read over all the feedback and give me
an executive summary.  It’s much easier for me to hear “It sounds like most people
are following, so you could speed up” than to read several notes all saying, “this is
too slow” or “this is boring”.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is part of the reason for Data Carpentry and Software Carpentry’s rule,
“Never teach alone.”
Having another instructor in the classroom saves your voice
(it’s hard to talk for two days straight),
but more importantly,
it’s a chance for instructors to learn from one another and be a supportive voice
in the room.</p>

<blockquote class="challenge">
  <h2 id="feedback-on-feedback">Feedback on Feedback</h2>

  <p>Watch either <a href="https://vimeo.com/139316669">this video</a> (8:40)
or <a href="https://vimeo.com/139181120">this one</a> (11:42).
Take notes about the presentation,
and divide those into four groups
based on whether they are positive or negative
and whether they are about the content (what was said)
or the presentation (how it was said, e.g., body language).
Compare your notes with those made by other people,
and with the feedback given by your instructor.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="challenge">
  <h2 id="feedback-on-yourself-part-ii">Feedback on Yourself, Part II</h2>
  <p>Later in the training,
repeat the first challenge exercise; however, when it comes time to give feedback,
use the same 2x2 scheme in the previous challenge.</p>
