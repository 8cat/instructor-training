<p>We have already covered certain elements of lesson design in our previous
lessons on educational psychology and how that can inform teaching tools.  In this
lesson, we will focus strictly on lesson design, using a strategy called reverse
instructional design, and specifically focusing on learning objectives.</p>

<h2 id="reverse-instructional-design">Reverse Instructional Design</h2>

<p>Most people design courses as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The chair tells you that you have to teach something you haven’t thought about in ten years.</li>
  <li>You start writing slides to explain what you know about the subject.</li>
  <li>After two or three weeks, you make up an assignment based more or less on what you’ve taught so far.</li>
  <li>You repeat step 3 several times.</li>
  <li>You stay up ‘til the wee hours to make up a final exam.</li>
</ol>

<p>There’s a better way,
and to explain it,
we first need to explain how
<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">test-driven development</a></em> (TDD)
is used in software development.
When programmers are using TDD,
they don’t write software and then (possibly) write tests.
Instead,
they write the tests first,
then write just enough new software to make those tests pass,
and then clean up a bit.</p>

<p>TDD works because writing tests forces programmers to specify
exactly what they’re trying to accomplish and what “done” looks like.
It’s easy to be vague when using a human language like English or Korean;
it’s much harder to be vague in Python or R.</p>

<p>TDD also reduces the risk of endless polishing,
and increases the likelihood that tests will actually get written.
(Somehow, people always seem to run out of time…)
Finally,
writing the tests first reduces the risk of confirmation bias:
someone who hasn’t written a program is much more likely to be objective when testing it
than its original author.</p>

<p>A similar “backward” method works very well for lesson design.
As described in Wiggins and McTighe’s
<em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Design-Expanded-Grant-Wiggins/dp/0131950843/">Understanding by Design</a></em>,
the method proceeds through four stages:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Identify what is worth learning (e.g., draw concept maps).</li>
  <li>Decide what constitutes evidence that learning has taken place
(i.e., create the final exam or some other summative assessment).</li>
  <li>Design practice work to prepare learners for what they will have to do during the summative assessment.
These should include formative assessments to be done in class
and the exercises to be done out of class.</li>
  <li>Sort those practices in order of increasing complexity
and then write short episodes to close the gap between what learners know and what they need to know
in order to do each one.
(An actual classroom lesson will then consist of several such episodes,
each building toward a quick formative assessment.)</li>
</ol>

<p>This <em>reverse instructional design</em> method helps keep teaching focused on its objectives.
It also ensures that learners don’t face anything on the final exam that the course hasn’t prepared them for.
When writing the lessons themselves,
Wiggins and McTighe use the acronym WHERETO:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Where</em>:
ensure that learners see the big picture,
can answer “Why?” questions,
and know the final performance expectations as soon as possible.</li>
  <li><em>Hook</em>:
immerse learners in the lesson’s ideas and issues.</li>
  <li><em>Equip</em>:
provide learners with the tools, skills, and information needed
to be successful in the upcoming formative assessment.</li>
  <li><em>Rethink</em>:
consider different perspectives,
challenge their prior assumptions, etc.</li>
  <li><em>Evaluate</em>:
ensure that the learners and the instructor get actionable feedback
from the formative assessment.</li>
  <li><em>Tailor</em>:
find ways to personalize learning through differentiated instruction and/or assessment.</li>
  <li><em>Organize</em>:
put the episodes in sequence.</li>
</ul>

  <h2 id="how-and-why-to-fake-it">How and Why to Fake It</h2>

  <p>One of the most influential papers in the history of software engineering
was Parnas and Clements’ “<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TSE.1986.6312940">A Rational Design Process: How and Why to Fake It</a>”
(<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/classes/121/IEEE86_Parnas_Clement.pdf">PDF</a>),
in which they pointed out that in real life we move back and forth between gathering requirements,
interface design,
programming,
and testing,
but when we write up our work
it’s important to describe it as if we did these steps one after another
so that other people can retrace our steps.
The same is true of lesson design:
while we may change our mind about what we want to teach
based on something that occurs to us while we’re writing an MCQ,
we want the notes we leave behind to present things in the order described above.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="challenge">
  <h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>

  <p>Is reverse instructional design “teaching to the test”?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reverse instructional design is <em>not</em> the same thing as “teaching to the test”.
When using RID, teachers set goals to aid in lesson design,
and may not never actually give the final exam that they wrote as a goal.
In many school systems,
on the other hand,
an external authority defines assessment criteria for all learners,
regardless of their individual situations,
and the outcomes of those summative assessments directly affect the teachers’ pay and promotion.
Green’s <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Building-Better-Teacher-Teaching-Everyone/dp/0393351084/">Building a Better Teacher</a></em>
focus on measurement with little (usually no) help for improving
centralized, standardized testing is appealing (particularly to those with the power to set the tests),
but as Scott pointed out in
<em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Seeing-like-State-Certain-Condition/dp/0300078153/">Seeing Like a State</a></em>,
large organizations invariably prefer uniformity to productivity.</p>

<h2 id="writing-learning-objectives">Writing Learning Objectives</h2>

<p>Summative and formative assessments help instructors figure out what they’re going to teach,
but in order to communicate that to learners and other instructors,
we should also write <em>learning objectives</em>.
It’s easy to come up with fuzzy ones like,
“Learners will gain an appreciation of the role of research software engineers in the research process.”
Useful ones take a bit more work.</p>

<p>What we want are specific, verifiable descriptions of what learners can do to demonstrate their learning.
Each learning objective should have <em>a measurable or verifiable verb</em> specifying what the learner will do,
and should specify the <em>criteria for acceptable performance</em>.
For example,
a better learning objective than the one above would be,
“Learners will list three things that make research software engineers distinct from
other specialists involved in the research process.”</p>

<p>In order to formulate good learning objectives we need to decide what kinds of learning we are aiming for.
There is a difference between knowing the atomic weight of fluorine
and understanding what elements it’s likely to bond with and why.
Similarly,
there’s a difference between being able to figure out why a microscope isn’t focusing properly
and being able to design a new microscope that focuses more easily.
What we need is a taxonomy of understanding
that is hierarchical, measurable, stable, and cross-cultural.</p>

<p>The best-known attempt to build one is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom's_taxonomy">Bloom’s taxonomy</a>,
which was first published in 1956.
More recent efforts are Wiggins and McTighe’s <em>facets of understanding</em>
and Fink’s taxonomy from his book
<em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Creating-Significant-Learning-Experiences-Integrated/dp/1118124251/">Creating Significant Learning Experiences</a></em>.
The table below compares them and shows some of the verbs typically used
in learning objectives written for each level.</p>

<h2 id="learner-profiles">Learner Profiles</h2>

<p>One way to characterize the audience for a course is to write <em>learner profiles</em>.
This technique is borrowed from user interface design,
where short profiles of typical users are created
to help designers think about their audience’s needs,
and to give them a shorthand for talking about specific cases.</p>

<p>Learner profiles have three parts:
the person’s general background,
the problem they face,
and how the course will help them.
A learner profile for Software Carpentry might be:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>João is an agricultural engineer doing his masters in soil physics.
His programming experience is a first year programming course using C.
He was never able to use this low-level programming into his activities,
and never programmed after the first year.</p>

  <p>His work consists of evaluating physical properties of soil samples from different conditions.
Some of the soil properties are measured by an automated device that sends logs in a text format to his machine.
João has to open each file in Excel,
crop the first and last quarters of points,
and calculate an average.</p>

  <p>Software Carpentry will show João how to write shell scripts to count the lines and crop the right range for each file,
and how to use R to read these files and calculate the required statistics.
It will also show him how to put his programs and files under version control
so that he can re-run analyses and figure out which results may have been affected by changes.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="challenge">
  <h2 id="learner-profiles-1">Learner Profiles</h2>

  <p>Read <a href="https://software-carpentry.org/audience/">Software Carpentry’s learner profiles</a>
and then write one that describes a fictional colleague of your own.
Who are they,
what problems do they face,
and how will this training help them?

This scheme is easy to understand,
but are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Great-Myths-Brain-Psychology/dp/1118312716/">almost certainly false</a>:
what little evidence that does exist for it is very weak.
Unfortunately,
that hasn’t stopped a large number of companies from marketing products based on it
